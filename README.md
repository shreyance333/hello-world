# Git Branch for game of Tic-Tac-Toe with Player X and O for 3 x 3 board (with human)

# How it works
# You will be presented with 3 x 3 board with empty spaces, 

# - | - | -
# - | - | -
# - | - | -

# Provide your input in empty spaces from Number 1 through 9 
# For Example - 
# 1 | 2 | 3 |
# 4 | 5 | 6 |
# 7 | 8 | 9 |

# By default first player would be X and second player O, if you enter 1, X will go to position 1, after X's turn its O's turn, enter position for O
# For X to win the game you should get X on all the elements of a row or  a column or diagonally and same goes for player O
# If you enter number greater than 9 it will prompt you to provide valid input that is number 1 through 9
# If you try to enter number on already used position again, it will prompt you, its not allowed and to enter valid input 
# If either of the player wins it outputs player (X or O) wins and terminates
# If no combination is achieved it outputs tie and terminates
