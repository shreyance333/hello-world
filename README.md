<br /> 1) Game of Tic-Tac-Toe with Player X and O for 3 x 3 board (with human)
<br /> 2) How it works
<br /> 3) You will be presented with 3 x 3 board with empty spaces, 

<br /> - | - | -
<br /> - | - | -
<br /> - | - | -

<br /> 4) Provide your input in empty spaces from Number 1 through 9 
<br /> 5) For Example - 

<br />1 | 2 | 3 |
<br />4 | 5 | 6 |
<br />7 | 8 | 9 |

<br /> 6) By default first player would be X and second player O, if you enter 1, X will go to position 1, after X's turn its O's turn, enter position for O
<br /> 7) For X to win the game you should get X on all the elements of a row or  a column or diagonally and same goes for player O
<br /> 8) If you enter number greater than 9 it will prompt you to provide valid input that is number 1 through 9
<br /> 9) If you try to enter number on already used position again, it will prompt you, its not allowed and to enter valid input 
<br /> 10) If either of the player wins it outputs player (X or O) wins and terminates
<br /> 11) If no combination is achieved it outputs tie and terminates
